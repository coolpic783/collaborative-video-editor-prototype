# README Collaborative Video Editor
SWEN-444 Prototype project of an online video editor that allows groups to collaborate on editing videos. We are currently working on the beta version of the prototype. There is no need for any installations. You will need an up-to-date browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox, and an optional text editor. All you need to do is click on the main.html file and it will open up the beta version of the product prototype. There are no backend, only front-end. 

Implemented functionalities include:
1. Send a chat message, and see it appears on the chatbox.
2. Choose export format, export platform, and exportation.
3. Add a video.
4. See a variety of edit tools. Tool labels will be revealed when hovered.

Unsupported features:
1. Responsive design
2. Add a real video
3. Networking in chat and video editing (very high sophistication)
4. Export a real video
5. Export a video to a real social platform
6. Usable edit tools
7. 3 or more videos added can lead to modified interface
8. Play or pause a video
9. See video timeline, and audio timeline
10. Search for videos

This is a pretty sophisticated product if the all the real functionalities are implemented. The purpose of this prototype is to show the user interface purely. Functionalities may be added in the final prototypes.
